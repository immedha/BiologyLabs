**For PTC Lab Report:**
The research in this paper determines if the allele frequency of the TAS2R38 gene in immigrants matches up with the allele frequency of the country that they immigrate to (in our case, the US). We ran both a general phenotype test and a genotype test utilizing PCR, a digestion enzyme, and gel electrophoresis on a group of 18 subjects from our class, who were mostly immigrants from other countries. 

The TAS2R38 gene allows certain individuals to taste the molecule Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The T allele of this gene allows individuals to taste PTC, while the t allele causes the individual to not be able to taste PTC at all. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms can help predict overall which of the two alleles a given individual has. A heterozygous individual is able to taste PTC, but only slightly. 

**For _Lac_ Operon Lab Report:**
This lab introduces gene regulation through exploration of the lac operon. Three E. coli cultures were used: one was grown in the presence of lactose, one in glucose, and one in the presence of both. These cultures were tested to have Î²-galactosidase activity, an enzyme that breaks down lactose into two simpler sugars, glucose and galactose. See the Lac Operon Students Manual, attached, for background. 

**For Genetics Lab Report: **
This lab explored Mendelian genetics using the inheritance of the plant _Brassica rapa_. The primary research question was, do the stem color (ANL gene) and stem height (ROS gene) genes of _B. rapa_ follow the rules of Mendelian genetics? P1, F1, and F2 generations of the _B. rapa_ plants were grown, and inheritance patterns were observed to conclude whether or not they followed the rules of Mendelian genetics.
